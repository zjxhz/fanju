This iOS app aimed to help people with same interests to meet by having a meal together. Later on, the activities did not include only meals, but also hiking, running, English corners(for Chinese speakers). Many users of this app became good friends, marathon runners, aced the IELTS exam and emmigrated to English speaking countries.

I am open-sourcing my personal projects like this one from [bitbucket](bitbucket.org) hoping that it would be useful to others, too.
